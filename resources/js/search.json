While being born and raised in the Twin Cities, I've been based out of Scottsdale, AZ since late 2023. I have a CCNP: Enterprise with a concentration in Advanced Routing and Services (ENARSI). When I'm not working or in my lab, you can find me hiking, traveling, or out by the pool.","This site and the labs within are currently unfinished and a work-in-progress.
