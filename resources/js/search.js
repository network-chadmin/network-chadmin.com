They can be acquired via a subscription to Cisco Modeling Labs and their refplat ISO.","If you have IOL as a virtual machine image, you must convert it into a containerized image before Containerlab can use it.

That power can be useful — but may be overkill for many diagrams.","draw.io- I've moved to draw.io as my diagram solution of choice since it's FOSS, supports exporting to several formats, is sufficiently powerful, and supports git. In a world where everything is a subscription, great quality free software is gold. I recommend any prospective network engineer learn how to make great diagrams, and draw.io is a wonderful application to learn.","Lucid Chart- Great solution for cross-platform diagrams, but it comes at the cost of a monthly subscription. Gentler learning curve than Visio, but capable of similarly in-depth diagrams.","Excalidraw- The king of quick diagrams and white-boarding sessions. If I need visualize something quickly or I'm asked to provide a diagram for something small, Excalidraw is my first choice."]},{"l":"Apps","p":["Obsidian- My note-taking program and personal knowledge-base. It's cross-platform, incredibly polished, and highly extensible with plugins. All notes are stored in markdown local to your machine. One of my all time favorite apps.","Raindrop.io- I use this to store bookmarks on the web so I'm not locked into a single web browser.","Visual Studio Code- My personal favorite text editor. Well-supported, powerful, and extensible with Github integration. There's an awesome Containerlab plugin that will free you from the Linux command line, generate diagrams, and more.","Wireshark- Needs no introduction. It's an engineers best friend and one of the best ways to really learn how this all works.","Claude- My LLM of choice. I've found Claude especially reliable when it comes to technical accuracy — great for reviewing configs, logic, and documentation."]},{"l":"Labs","p":["Containerlab- The platform that inspired me to create this site in the first place.
