That power can be useful — but may be overkill for many diagrams.","draw.io- I've moved to draw.io as my diagram solution of choice since it's FOSS, supports exporting to several formats, is sufficiently powerful, and supports git. In a world where everything is a subscription, great quality free software is gold. I recommend any prospective network engineer learn how to make great diagrams, and draw.io is a wonderful application to learn.","Lucid Chart- Great solution for cross-platform diagrams, but it comes at the cost of a monthly subscription.

Well-supported, powerful, and extensible with Github integration. There's an awesome Containerlab plugin that will free you from the Linux command line, generate diagrams, and more.","Wireshark- Needs no introduction.

Each lab reuses hostnames (like sea-a1-asw1, sea-mdf-r1, etc.), but assigns unique management IPs per device instance. This allows labs to run side-by-side without port conflicts — helpful in multi-user environments.","5. Each device tag has both the Docker management IP address, and the in-lab management IP address. Both will be shown on the device tags on each lab topology.","172.16.25.62 is the docker management IP, while 10.1.99.30 is the one you will configure in-lab.","6. Emulated networks like these can be buggy at times and certain things that may not work exactly like they do on a physical device. If your network isn't working how you think it should it's probably still your fault, but know these things can get goofy sometimes.","The YML files reference an image and version for each container as image: vrnetlab/cisco_iol:17.15.01. You can use a different version of cEOS or Cisco IOL than is referenced in the lab files, but you'll need to change the version tag for every device in the YML file before you deploy.","Let's say when you convert your Cisco IOL image to a container using vrnetlab it's now 17.15.02.
