# What is Network Academy?
Network Academy started as a way to help my coworkers learn networking through hands-on practice. What began as internal training material has grown into a public resource for anyone building real-world skills from the ground up.

I believe labbing — and learning to enjoy it — is the key to success in this field. My goal isn’t just to teach concepts, but to help you build confidence by building networks.

## [Shrimp Co. - Network Fundamentals](/labs/network-academy/shrimp-co/)

**Shrimp Co.** was the original inspiration behind Network Academy and the reason this site exists today.

This course begins with a simple single-switch setup and two VLANs, gradually expanding into a full-scale topology with dynamic routing, tunneling, and multiple Linux hosts.

While it starts off beginner-friendly, Shrimp Co. ramps up quickly — by the later labs you’ll be building GRE tunnels, running OSPF across multiple areas, and configuring MLAG for redundancy.

There's less handholding as the series progresses, but that’s intentional. These are real skills you’ll use in the field.

## [SeaMart - Zero to Routing Hero](/labs/network-academy/seamart/) (Coming Soon)

Routing is a core skill in computer networking. Mastering it not only makes you a more valuable engineer, but it’s essential for those pursuing design and architecture roles.

In the **SeaMart** series, you’ll step into the role of a Campus and WAN engineer for a seafood retail chain. You’ll handle greenfield deployments, brownfield migrations, and real-world troubleshooting as you work toward routing mastery.

Starting with basic static and dynamic routing, you'll gradually build a large-scale routed environment—incorporating advanced concepts like mutual redistribution and route filtering along the way.

## Volt Communications - Mastering BGP (Coming Soon)

Take on the role of a service provider engineer for Volt Communications, a fictional ISP.  
This series focuses on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the internet’s foundational routing protocol.  
You’ll dive into peering design, path selection, prefix filtering, and BGP scalability features like route reflectors and confederations.
