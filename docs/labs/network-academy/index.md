> Master networking fundamentals with hands-on labs and enterprise-inspired designs.

# What is Network Academy?
Network Academy started with a simple goal: help colleagues who were new to networking learn through hands-on labs. What began as internal training material has since grown into a public resource for anyone looking to build real skills through practice.

I believe labbing — and learning to enjoy labbing — is the secret to success in this field. My goal isn’t just to teach networking concepts, but to inspire you to build your own labs and take ownership of your learning.

**Shrimp Co.** was the original inspiration behind Network Academy and the reason this site exists today.

This course begins with a simple single-switch setup and two VLANs, gradually expanding into a full-scale topology with dynamic routing, tunneling, and multiple Linux hosts.

While it's designed with beginners in mind, even seasoned learners will find value in advanced stretch goals like Linux administration and network services.

Routing is a core skill in computer networking. Mastering it not only makes you a more valuable engineer, but it’s essential for those pursuing design and architecture roles.

In the **SeaMart** series, you’ll step into the role of a Campus and WAN engineer for a seafood retail chain. You’ll handle greenfield deployments, brownfield migrations, and real-world troubleshooting as you work toward routing mastery.

Starting with basic static and dynamic routing, you'll gradually build a large-scale routed environment—incorporating advanced concepts like mutual redistribution and route filtering along the way.
