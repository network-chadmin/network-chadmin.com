## What is Network Academy?
Network Academy started as a way to help my colleagues learn networking through hands-on practice. What began as internal training material has grown into a public resource for anyone building real-world skills from the ground up.

I believe labbing — and learning to enjoy it — is the key to success in this field. My goal isn’t just to teach concepts, but to help you build confidence by building complete networks where you can see how all these concepts work together in an enterprise environment.

## [Shrimp Co. - Network Fundamentals](/labs/network-academy/shrimp-co/)

-![Enterprise Infrastructure, built from scratch.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/network-chadmin/network-chadmin.com/refs/heads/main/docs/static/network-academy/shrimp-co-transparent.png){class="rounded-lg" width="300" height="200"}

**Shrimp Co.** was the original inspiration behind Network Academy and the reason this site exists today.

This course begins with a simple single-switch setup and two VLANs, gradually expanding into a full-scale topology with dynamic routing, tunneling, and multiple Linux hosts.

While it starts off beginner-friendly, Shrimp Co. ramps up quickly — by the final lab you’ll be building GRE tunnels, running OSPF across multiple areas, and peering with your ISP using BGP.

There's less handholding as the series progresses, but that’s intentional. These are real skills you’ll use in the field.

## [SeaMart - Zero to Routing Hero](/labs/network-academy/seamart/) (Coming Soon)

-![A magnificent journey through layer 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/network-chadmin/network-chadmin.com/refs/heads/main/docs/static/network-academy/seamart-transparent.png){class="rounded-lg" width="300" height="200"}

Routing is a core skill in computer networking. Mastering it not only makes you a more valuable engineer, but it’s essential for those pursuing design and architecture roles.

In the **SeaMart** series, you’ll step into the role of a Campus and WAN engineer for a seafood retail chain. You’ll handle greenfield deployments, brownfield migrations, and real-world troubleshooting as you work toward routing mastery.

Starting with basic static and dynamic routing, you'll gradually build a large-scale routed environment, incorporating advanced concepts like mutual redistribution and route filtering along the way.

SeaMart’s guided approach builds confidence in routing protocols and techniques, empowering you to excel at CCNP and beyond.

## Volt Communications - Mastering BGP (Coming Soon)

-![BGP runs the world, how well do you know it?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/network-chadmin/network-chadmin.com/refs/heads/main/docs/static/network-academy/volt-communications-transparent.png){class="rounded-lg" width="300" height="200"}

Take on the role of a service provider network engineer for Volt Communications, a fictional ISP serving customers across the globe.

In this series, you’ll master Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the internet’s foundational routing protocol. You’ll work through realistic scenarios involving peering design, path selection, and prefix filtering, while exploring advanced BGP scalability techniques like route reflectors, confederations, and communities.

Starting with core BGP concepts and progressing into complex multi-AS designs, you’ll gain the skills to troubleshoot and optimize interdomain routing with confidence.

Through hands-on labs and enterprise-grade configurations, Volt Communications will prepare you to design, deploy, and maintain robust BGP architectures; knowledge that’s critical for CCNP and CCIE-level expertise.
