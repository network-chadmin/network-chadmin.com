## :icon-tasklist: Configuration Tasks

### VLAN Configuration

Create and configure the following VLANs on **both switches**:

- **VLAN 10** - Sales
- **VLAN 20** - Engineering 
- **VLAN 99** - IT

### Host & Access Port Configuration

| **Host** | **VLAN Assignment** | **IP Address** |
|------|------|------|
| Bob | 10 (Sales) | 10.1.10.10/24 |
| Alice | 20 (Engineering) | 10.1.20.10/24 |
| Steve | 99 (IT) | 10.1.99.100/24 |
| Linda | 10 (Sales) | 10.1.10.20/24 |

### Switchport Configuration

- Configure the inter-switch link (Eth3 on both switches) as trunk to carry only VLANs 10,20, and 99.
- Configure switch uplinks to router (Eth4 on both switches) as a trunk, allowing only necessary VLANs.
- Configure VLAN 99 SVI for sea-a1-asw1 - **10.1.99.10/24**
- Configure VLAN 99 SVI for sea-b1-asw1 - **10.1.99.20/24**

### Router Configuration

- Configure gateways as subinterfaces for inter-VLAN routing:
    - Eth1.10 with IP **10.1.10.1/24**
    - Eth1.20 with IP **10.1.20.1/24**
    - Eth2.99 with IP **10.1.99.1/24**
- Configure Loopback0 with IP **10.255.1.1/32**

!!!warning
Because Arista EOS uses the same code train for both switches and routers you need enabling routing globally with the command `ip routing` alongside specifying when a port is routed by issuing `no switchport` on the physical interface.  This does **not** need to be done on the subinterface.
!!!

!!!primary
While traditionally "router-on-a-stick" refers to a single physical interface carrying multiple tagged VLANs, in this lab `sea-mdf-r1` utilizes two physical interfaces (`Eth1` and `Eth2`) in a "multi-stick" design.  This choice was made for visual symmetry and doesnâ€™t necessarily reflect best-practice network design.

## :icon-check-circle: Success Criteria

+++ Primary Goals
- Bob and Alice can ping each other (Inter-VLAN routing functioning)
- All hosts can ping their respective gateways
- Ping Loopback0 from Linda
+++ Stretch Goals
- Run `tcpdump interface ethernet4 filter tcp` on **sea-b1-asw1**
- Configure router with local user account other than admin, SSH to it from Steve.
- Look for the mac-addresses in the L2 header in your tcpdump and find on what interfaces the switch learned them.  Then, on each device find a command that will output that interface's mac address to your terminal.
+++

## Verification Commands
+++ Switch Verification
```bash

# Show VLAN configuration
show vlan [brief]

# Show trunk interfaces and allowed VLANs
show interfaces trunk

# Show interface status and mode
show interfaces status

# Show MAC address table
show mac address-table [address] [dynamic] 
```
+++ Router Verification
```bash
# Show ARP table
show ip arp

# Show routing table
show ip route
```
+++ Host Verification
```bash
# Test reachability
ping X.X.X.X # (ping 10.1.20.1)

# Show network interface information
ifconfig

# Show default route/routing information
ip route show
```

### Questions to Explore
- Why does router-on-a-stick use sub-interfaces instead of separate physical connections?
- What kind of routes are each subnet in the routing table?
- What happens to the VLAN tags when traffic reaches the router sub-interface?
- Why do hosts need default gateways configured now when they didn't before?
- What's the purpose of an ARP table? Where is it found?
- Imagine the scenario: Steve pings Loopback0 on sea-mdf-r1, when the router goes to send the return traffic how will the L2 & L3 headers look? What does the router use to build it?

!!!tip "Host Access"
If SSH isn't working: `docker exec -it <container-name> bash`

Configure static IP: `sudo ip addr add 10.1.10.10/24 dev eth1`
Configure default route: `sudo ip route add default via 10.1.20.1 dev eth1`

!!!warning
Arista documentation isn't nearly as ubiquitous as Cisco's, nor can you find many beginner-friendly resources.  In this case, there's no reference for Layer 3 subinterfaces in their user guide at all.  The command-line syntax is extremely similar to Cisco though, so finding a guide for a Cisco configuration will get you most of the way there.  I recommend [Network Lessons](https://www.network.lessons.com)
