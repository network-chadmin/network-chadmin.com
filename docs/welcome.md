!!!warning Work in Progress
This site is still under active development — many labs are incomplete or evolving.
Cloning my GitHub right now won’t give you the full experience.  
Check back soon for the finished version of my first lab series: **Shrimp Co.** 🦐

## What You'll Find Here

### :icon-mortar-board: [Network Academy](labs/network-academy)

This project is built around [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) and modern network simulation workflows.  
You’ll progress from basic VLANs to complex multi-site architectures through practical, hands-on labs designed for clarity, realism, and growth.

- **Beginner-friendly** progression from Layer 2 to Dynamic Layer 3  
- **Real-world scenarios** with Linux hosts and containerized network OSs  
- **Modern**, scalable lab environment  
- **Clear objectives**, success criteria, and stretch goals  

### :icon-beaker: Other Labs & Experiments

Standalone labs where I explore automation, emerging technologies, and advanced routing designs.

### :icon-project-roadmap: [Technical Blog](/blog/)

Deep dives into network concepts, troubleshooting notes, and lessons from real-world projects.

### :icon-tools: [Resources & Tools](/resources/)

A curated collection of the tools, platforms, and applications I use regularly as a network engineer.
